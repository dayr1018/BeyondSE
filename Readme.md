How to use Ant (Team E)

1. Go to directory where build.xml is located. Write "ant" on command line, and folders "/src", "/build", "/build/classes , "/lib", "/doc", "/dist" will pop up on same directory.

2. Put java files into "/src", and Jtidy library into "/lib".

3. Write "ant" again, then it will compile java file into classes and make a jar "MD_HTML_Converter.jar" in "/dist".

4. Put "test.html" file into directory where "MD_HTML_Converter.jar" is located.

5. Once project jar file is executed, it will check HTML grammar.
